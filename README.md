## Basic Usage <a name="basic-usage">

### Viewing <a name="viewing">

</p>

Then, users can select local file(s) that they wish to share, and optionaly include tags or make the upload private to other users. 

The Images will then be saved into Google Firebase Storage and their associate meta-info (such as urls to Firebase Storage, creation time, author info, etc) will be stored into Google Firebase Firestore in real-time, so that other users' home pages will be updated immediately.
